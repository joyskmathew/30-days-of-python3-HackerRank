# Day 1: Data Types

## Objective
Today, we're discussing data types.

## Task
Complete the code in the editor below. The variables **i**,**d** and **s** are already declared and initialized for you. You must:

Declare **3** variables: one of type int, one of type double, and one of type String.

Read **3** lines of input from stdin (according to the sequence given in the Input Format section below) and initialize your
**3** variables.

Use the **+** operator to perform the following operations:

1. Print the sum of **i** plus your int variable on a new line.

2. Print the sum of **d** plus your double variable to a scale of one decimal place on a new line.

3. Concatenate **s** with the string you read as input and print the result on a new line.
