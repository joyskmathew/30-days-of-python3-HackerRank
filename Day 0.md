# Day 0: Hello,World

## Objective
In this challenge, we review some basic concepts that will get you started with this series. 

## Task
To complete this challenge, you must save a line of input from stdin to a variable, print Hello, World on a single line, and finally print the value of your variable on a second line.

## Code
```
# Read a full line of input from stdin and save it to our dynamically typed variable, input_string.
input_string = input()

# Print a string literal saying "Hello, World." to stdout.
print('Hello, World.')

# TODO: Write a line of code here that prints the contents of input_string to stdout.
print(input_string)
```
## Explanation
*On the first line, we print the string literal Hello, World.. On the second line, we print the contents of the variable which, for this sample case, happens to be Welcome to 30 Days of Code!. If you do not print the variable's contents to stdout, you will not pass the hidden test case.*
